# Orchestrating self learning mode of Rust for Bitcoiners

1. Each module will be divided into 3-6 short recorded videos explaining the concepts.
1. After each video there will be a link to the exercise with automated tests, to promote active learning.
1. Make all the assignments autograded and students can ask for review or feedback on github?
1. Provide async support in discord
1. Weekly office hours for students?

Once this is completed we will be having a pipeline which produces devs who are now familiar with Rust.
Then we can work on advanced bitcoin or lightning related course materials and assignments in Rust.

This self learning mode will be ready to be published in Udemy if that is required.
Especially Rust Bitcoin courses are rare in Udemy like platforms and after completing this we can
focus of publishing course related to lightning, nostr etc., This will definitely attract the ambitious.
And if they find these advanced Rust courses difficult they can fallback to Rust for bitcoiners.

## Time required to complete the self learning mode of Rust for Bitcoiners

I'm planning to write the scripts first and then record the video.
Since I've already done this I expect to be able to complete 1 module per day for recording.
I might be inefficient at the beginning but hope to get better.
For exercises and assignments it's all about the ideas, once it clicks then it should be easy.
Overall estimating 2-4 weeks to get this ready.
